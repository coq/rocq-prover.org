    description: >
      Dune is a build system that was designed to simplify the release ofJane Street packages. It reads metadata from \dune\ files following avery simple s-expression syntax.Dune is fast, has very low-overhead, and supports parallel builds onall platforms. It has no system dependencies; all you need to builddune or packages using dune is OCaml. You don'apos;t need make or bashas long as the packages themselves don'apos;t use bash explicitly.Dune is composable; supporting multi-package development by simplydropping multiple repositories into the same directory.Dune also supports multi-context builds, such as building againstseveral opam roots/switches simultaneously. This helps maintainingpackages across several versions of OCaml and gives cross-compilationfor free.

    description: >
      This library provides `ring`, `field`, `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics forthe Mathematical Components library. These tactics use the algebraicstructures defined in the MathComp library and their canonical instances forthe instance resolution, and do not require any special instance declaration,like the `Add Ring` and `Add Field` commands. Therefore, each of these tacticsworks with any instance of the respective structure, including concreteinstances declared through Hierarchy Builder, abstract instances, and mixedconcrete and abstract instances, e.g., `int * R` where `R` is an abstractcommutative ring. Another key feature of Algebra Tactics is that theyautomatically push down ring morphisms and additive functions to leaves ofring/field expressions before applying the proof procedures.

    synopsis:  An extended \Standard Library\ for Coq
    description: >
      The key features of this library are as follows:- It provides a great number of definitions and lemmas for common data  structures such as lists, finite maps, finite sets, and finite multisets.- It uses type classes for common notations (like `∅`, `∪`, and Haskell-style  monad notations) so that these can be overloaded for different data structures.- It uses type classes to keep track of common properties of types, like it  having decidable equality or being countable or finite.- Most data structures are represented in canonical ways so that Leibniz  equality can be used as much as possible (for example, for maps we have  `m1 = m2` iff `∀ i, m1 !! i = m2 !! i`). On top of that, the library provides  setoid instances for most types and operations.- It provides various tactics for common tasks, like an ssreflect inspired  `done` tactic for finishing trivial goals, a simple breadth-first solver  `naive_solver`, an equality simplifier `simplify_eq`, a solver `solve_proper`  for proving compatibility of functions with respect to relations, and a solver  `set_solver` for goals involving set operations.- It is entirely dependency- and axiom-free.

    description: >
      E is a theorem prover for first-order and higher-order logic with equality. It accepts a problem specification, typically consisting of a number of first-order clauses or formulas, and a conjecture, in clausal or full first-order/higher-order form. The system will then try to find a formal proof for the conjecture, assuming the axioms.

    description: >
      ### coqutil -- Various Coq UtilitiesContents:* [Datatypes](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/tree/master/src/coqutil/Datatypes): Some utilities for existing datatypes, and new datatypes.* [Decidable](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/blob/master/src/coqutil/Decidable.v): `BoolSpec`-based decidability typeclasses. Allows one to write `if MyType_eqb a b then ... else ...` where `MyType_eqb a b` returns a `bool`, instead of writing `if MyType_eq_dec a b then ... else ...` where `MyType_eq_dec a b` returns a `sumbool`, while still getting `a = b` and `a gt; b` as hypotheses (as opposed to `MyType_eqb a b = true` and `MyType_eqb a b = false`) after destructing the `if` (need to use [`destr`](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/blob/master/src/coqutil/Tactics/destr.v) instead of `destruct`). So one gets the benefits of `Sumbool` without getting its disadvantage of having to carry around proof terms, which can cause a blow-up under reduction if one is not careful.* [Map](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/tree/master/src/coqutil/Map): A typeclass based map library allowing one to abstract over the concrete implementation of maps. The implementations have to be extensional, which excludes certain efficient implementations, but simplifies proofs, because one can `replace mapA with mapB` if one can prove that `mapA` and `mapB` have the same contents. Comes with a [solver](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/blob/master/src/coqutil/Map/Solver.v) which works reasonably fast on most map goals we have encountered so far.* [Tactics](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/tree/master/src/coqutil/Tactics): A collection of useful general-purpose tactics.* [Word](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/tree/master/src/coqutil/Word): Fixed width words for any width, in the same typeclass based style as the map library. Designed for the case where all words have the same (potentially abstract) bit width. Therefore, it does not provide functions to concatenate and split words, which is better addressed by [bbv](https://github.com/mit-plv/bbv/).* [Z](https://github.com/mit-plv/coqutil/tree/master/src/coqutil/Z): Utilities to work with the `Z` type from Coq'apos;s standard library, including a tactic to prove `Z` equalities by splitting the equality into equalities on bit index ranges, a tactic to make `lia` capable of reasoning about goals with division and modulo, and a tactic to simplify expressions containing nested occurrences of `mod`, and more misc utilities.* Various macros, notations, and desirable default settings.Each feature is intended to be as minimal and as independent of the other features as possible, so that users can pick just what they need.

It providesa formal language to write mathematical definitions, executablealgorithms and theorems together with an environment forsemi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.Typical applications include the certification of properties ofprogramming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certificationproject, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), theformalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of theFeit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching.This package includes the Coq core binaries, plugins, and tools, butnot the vernacular standard library.Note that in this setup, Coq needs to be started with the -boot and-noinit options, as will otherwise fail to find the regular Coqprelude, now living in the coq-stdlib package.

Currently `Ast.term →Ast.term` and `(Σ ;;; [] |- t : T) → Ast.term` functions are providedfor Template and PCUIC terms, in `MetaCoq.Quotation.ToTemplate.All`and `MetaCoq.Quotation.ToPCUIC.All`.  Proving well-typedness is stilla work in progress.Ultimately the goal of this development is to prove that `□` is a lax monoidalsemicomonad (a functor with `cojoin : □T → □□T` that codistributes over `unit`and `×`), which is sufficient for proving Löb'apos;s theorem.

    synopsis:  ELPI - Embeddable λProlog Interpreter
    description: >
      ELPI implements a variant of λProlog enriched with Constraint Handling Rules,a programming language well suited to manipulate syntax trees with binders.ELPI is designed to be embedded into larger applications written in OCaml asan extension language. It comes with an API to drive the interpreter and with an FFI for defining built-in predicates and data types, as well asquotations and similar goodies that are handy to adapt the language to the hostapplication.This package provides both a command line interpreter (elpi) and a library tobe linked in other applications (eg by passing -package elpi to ocamlfind).The ELPI programming language has the following features:- Native support for variable binding and substitution, via an Higher Order  Abstract Syntax (HOAS) embedding of the object language. The programmer  does not need to care about technical devices to handle bound variables,  like De Bruijn indices.- Native support for hypothetical context. When moving under a binder one can  attach to the bound variable extra information that is collected when the  variable gets out of scope. For example when writing a type-checker the  programmer needs not to care about managing the typing context.- Native support for higher order unification variables, again via HOAS.  Unification variables of the meta-language (λProlog) can be reused to  represent the unification variables of the object language. The programmer  does not need to care about the unification-variable assignment map and  cannot assign to a unification variable a term containing variables out of  scope, or build a circular assignment.- Native support for syntactic constraints and their meta-level handling rules.  The generative semantics of Prolog can be disabled by turning a goal into a  syntactic constraint (suspended goal). A syntactic constraint is resumed as  soon as relevant variables gets assigned. Syntactic constraints can be  manipulated by constraint handling rules (CHR).- Native support for backtracking. To ease implementation of search.- The constraint store is extensible.  The host application can declare  non-syntactic constraints and use custom constraint solvers to check their  consistency.- Clauses are graftable. The user is free to extend an existing program by  inserting/removing clauses, both at runtime (using implication) and at  \compilation\ time by accumulating files.ELPI is free software released under the terms of LGPL 2.1 or above.
